get_pathway_view(
  genes,
  markers,
  cell_type,
  organism_db,

\arguments{
\item{markers}{a dataframe of gene expression. It can be generated from
\code{find_DE_genes}}

\item{cell_type}{which cell type to analyse}

\item{organism_db}{the database for the organism to be investigated}

\item{pathname}{which pathway to view}

\item{save_dir}{where to save the results}

\item{pathway_db}{a dataframe with 2 columns: 'pathway' for the common names
of the pathway that is used for naming the output file, and 'kegg_id' for
the KEGG ID for that pathway. This ID may be obtained from:
https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html}

\item{gene}{a vector of gene names}
}
\description{
Plot the average expression of a list of genes in one cell type
on a pathview plot
}
